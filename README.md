# KubeLinter Reporter Action

![test workflow][test-badge]

## Overview

This action aims to provide support for generating reports for [KubeLinter][kube-linter], a static analysis tool that
checks Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts to ensure the applications represented in them adhere to best practices.

Several output modes are supported depending on the user input and if the action is run on a pull request:

- `pr-comment` - report will be added as a comment on PR.
- `check` - report will be added in a GitHub check.
- `summary` - report will be added as a summary.

### Examples

Below we illustrate examples of expected outputs depending on the report mode.

#### Mode `pr-comment`

> ℹ️ By default when the action runs with `pr-comment` mode in a non pull-request context this mode will be ignored and
> if no additional mode was provided we will produce a report using `check` mode .

When running in `pr-comment` mode in case of no errors found you will get a comment in you pull request that should look
as follows

![pr-comment-ok](docs/images/pr_comment_ok_example.png)

If errors are found then a nice table will appear in a form of pull request comment highlighting all the important
details for the report as in the example below

![pr-comment-error](docs/images/pr_comment_error_example.png)

#### Mode `check`

When running in `check` mode a GitHub check will be created to add the report. In case of no errors found your check
will succeed, and you will get something as follows

![check-ok](docs/images/check_ok_example.png)

If errors are found, the GitHub check will fail, and you will obtain the following

![check-error](docs/images/check_error_example.png)

#### Mode `summary`

When running in `summary` mode a summary will be created with the following if no errors are found

![summary-ok](docs/images/summary_ok_example.png)

And in case of errors with the following

![summary-error](docs/images/summary_error_example.png)
